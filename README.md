# AtliQ-Hardware-Business-Insights-360

## Project Overview

AtliQ Hardware is growing rapidly in recent years, and they have decided to implement data analytics using Power BI to surpass their competitors in the market and make data-driven decisions. This project answers stakeholders' questions across finance, sales, marketing, and supply chain.

I worked on this project by following the Codebasics Power BI Course. Link to the course is [here](https://codebasics.io/bootcamps/dashboard/data-analytics-bootcamp-with-practical-job-assistance).

        - This table is used to forecast the customer‚Äôs need in advance, which can help in
            - Higher customer satisfaction
            - Reduced cost in warehouses for storage purpose
        - The table is denormalized by data engineering team, as it is a data warehouse which is aimed to be used for analytical work.
        - All the date of the month will be replaced by the start date of the month
        - It will have all the column names and in the end it will have the forecast quantity need of the customer
